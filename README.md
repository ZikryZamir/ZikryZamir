### 👨‍💻 About Me

Hi! I’m **Zikry**, a developer who started his journey building a real-world solution for public transport 🚍. My main project is **[Transitradar](https://github.com/ZikryZamir/Transitradar)** — a mobile app that began as my final year university project and continues to grow during my free time. It uses **GTFS-R API** from the Malaysian government to provide real-time transit info.

In addition to mobile development, I also enjoy exploring **data analytics** and **data visualization** 📊. You’ll find a mix of practical projects, visualizations, and some of my past university assignments here — all open for learning, sharing, or just geeking out!
